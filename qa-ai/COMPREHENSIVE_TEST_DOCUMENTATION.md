# ShareConnect Comprehensive AI QA Test Documentation

## Overview

This document provides detailed, human-readable documentation for all automated test cases in the ShareConnect AI QA system. Each test case includes step-by-step instructions, expected results, and validation criteria.

## Test Architecture

### Mock Services
All tests use comprehensive mock services instead of real external dependencies:
- **MeTube** (Port 8081): Simulates video downloads from streaming platforms
- **YT-DLP** (Port 8082): Handles direct downloads and metadata extraction
- **qBittorrent** (Port 8083): Mock torrent client with full API simulation
- **Transmission** (Port 9091): Complete Transmission RPC API simulation
- **uTorrent** (Port 8080): uTorrent WebUI API simulation
- **JDownloader** (Port 3129): JDownloader API for premium downloads

### Test Scenarios
Tests are organized by app installation combinations:
- **Single App**: Individual app functionality
- **Dual App**: Two apps with sync
- **Triple App**: Three apps with complex sync
- **All Apps**: Complete ecosystem testing
- **Lifecycle**: App state and background behavior
- **Sharing**: URL sharing and system integration
