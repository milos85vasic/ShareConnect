        # 1. Execute test steps
        for step in test_case.steps:
            await self.execute_step(step)
            screenshot = await self.capture_screenshot()

            # 2. AI visual validation

            # 3. Analyze and report
            if not validation.passed:
                return self.generate_failure_report(
                    step, screenshot, validation.reason
