## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Common Architecture Patterns

All Phase 1 connectors follow established ShareConnect patterns:

1. **API Client Layer**
   ```kotlin
   class ServiceApiClient {
       suspend fun operation(): Result<DataType> = withContext(Dispatchers.IO) {
           try {
               // API call
               Result.success(data)
           } catch (e: Exception) {
               Log.e(tag, "Error", e)
               Result.failure(e)
           }
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Repository Pattern**
   - Data access abstraction
   - Room database integration
   - Sync manager coordination

3. **ViewModel Pattern**
   - UI state management
   - Coroutine lifecycle scoping
   - Error handling and user feedback

4. **Compose UI**
   - Material Design 3 theming
   - Reusable DesignSystem components
   - Responsive layouts

### Authentication Strategies Implemented

- **Plex:** PIN-based OAuth flow with token management
- **Nextcloud:** Basic Auth + App Password support
- **Motrix:** Token-based authentication with secret
- **Gitea:** Personal Access Token (PAT) authentication

### Sync Integration

Each connector integrates 8 sync modules:
1. ThemeSync (port 8890)
2. ProfileSync (port 8900)
3. HistorySync (port 8910)
4. RSSSync (port 8920)
5. BookmarkSync (port 8930)
6. PreferencesSync (port 8940)
7. LanguageSync (port 8950)
8. TorrentSharingSync (port 8960)

All sync operations use Asinka's gRPC-based IPC with SQLCipher encryption.

## 🐛 Known Issues & Challenges

### Testing Challenges

**Issue: Retrofit + Robolectric SSL/TLS Configuration**
- **Problem:** MockWebServer tests fail with KeyStoreException in Robolectric environment
- **Cause:** Retrofit's OkHttp client initializes SSL/TLS in a way that conflicts with Robolectric's shadow implementations
- **Impact:** Unit tests cannot run with current MockWebServer approach

**Recommended Solutions:**
1. **Short-term:** Use MockK to mock Retrofit service interfaces directly
   ```kotlin
   val mockService = mockk<PlexApiService>()
   coEvery { mockService.getLibraries(any(), any()) } returns Response.success(mockData)
   ```

2. **Medium-term:** Create custom OkHttp client builder for tests that bypasses SSL
   ```kotlin
   fun createTestClient(): OkHttpClient {
       return OkHttpClient.Builder()
           .sslSocketFactory(createInsecureSSLSocketFactory())
           .hostnameVerifier { _, _ -> true }
           .build()
   }
   ```

3. **Long-term:** Switch to integration tests with real service instances (Docker containers)

## 📝 Lessons Learned

1. **Retrofit + Robolectric Complexity:** Mocking service interfaces is more reliable than MockWebServer for Retrofit-based APIs in unit tests

2. **Build System Stability:** All connectors building shows solid foundation

3. **Integration Pattern Success:** The 8-module sync integration works seamlessly across all connectors

4. **API Client Pattern:** The dedicated API client approach scales well

5. **Testing Strategy:** Unit testing HTTP clients requires careful SSL/TLS configuration or interface mocking
