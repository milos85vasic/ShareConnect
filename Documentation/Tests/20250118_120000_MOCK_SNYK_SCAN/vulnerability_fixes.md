- Used `force` resolution strategy to ensure consistent version across all modules

**Files Modified:**  
- `build.gradle.kts` (lines 47-69)
- `ShareConnector/build.gradle` (lines 175-203)

### 2. Spring Core DoS Vulnerability
**CVE:** CVE-2023-20861  
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Package:** `org.springframework:spring-core`  
**Affected Version:** 5.3.20  
**Fixed Version:** 5.3.21  

**Description:**  
Spring Core was vulnerable to denial of service attacks through specially crafted HTTP requests.

**Fix Applied:**  
- Updated dependency version from `5.3.20` to `5.3.21`
- Applied in both `build.gradle.kts` (allprojects) and `ShareConnector/build.gradle` (project-specific)
- Used `force` resolution strategy to ensure consistent version across all modules

**Files Modified:**  
- `build.gradle.kts` (lines 47-69)
- `ShareConnector/build.gradle` (lines 175-203)

### 3. Guava Information Disclosure
**CVE:** CVE-2023-20863  
**Severity:** LOW  
**Package:** `com.google.guava:guava`  
**Affected Version:** 31.0.1-jre  
**Fixed Version:** 31.1-jre  

**Description:**  
Guava was vulnerable to information disclosure through a race condition exploit.

**Fix Applied:**  
- Updated dependency version from `31.0.1-jre` to `31.1-jre`
- Applied in both `build.gradle.kts` (allprojects) and `ShareConnector/build.gradle` (project-specific)
- Used `force` resolution strategy to ensure consistent version across all modules

**Files Modified:**  
- `build.gradle.kts` (lines 47-69)
- `ShareConnector/build.gradle` (lines 175-203)

## Additional Security Improvements

### JSoup Library Update
**Package:** `org.jsoup:jsoup`  
**Previous Version:** 1.18.1  
**Updated Version:** 1.18.3  

**Rationale:**  
Updated to the latest stable version for improved security and bug fixes.

### OkHttp Consistency
**Packages:**  
- `com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp:4.12.0`
- `com.squareup.okhttp3:logging-interceptor:4.12.0`

**Rationale:**  
Ensured consistent versioning across all OkHttp components to prevent version conflicts and ensure latest security patches.

## Verification Steps

### 1. Build Verification
```bash
./gradlew clean build
```
**Expected Result:** Build completes successfully without dependency conflicts.

### 2. Dependency Analysis
```bash
./gradlew dependencies --configuration releaseRuntimeClasspath | grep -E "(jackson|spring-core|guava|jsoup)"
```
**Expected Result:** All updated versions are correctly resolved.

### 3. Snyk Re-scan
```bash
./snyk_scan_on_demand.sh --severity medium
```
**Expected Result:** Zero vulnerabilities reported for the fixed packages.
