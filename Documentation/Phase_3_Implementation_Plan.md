- **Conditions:** Rules that must be met (if statements)
- **Actions:** Operations to perform (API calls, notifications, state changes)

**Workflow Definition:**
```kotlin
data class AutomationWorkflow(
    val id: String,
    val name: String,
    val description: String,
    val triggers: List<Trigger>,
    val conditions: List<Condition>,
    val actions: List<Action>,
    val enabled: Boolean
)

sealed class Trigger {
    data class TimeTrigger(val cron: String) : Trigger()
    data class StateChangeTrigger(val entityId: String, val from: String, val to: String) : Trigger()
    data class WebhookTrigger(val path: String) : Trigger()
    data class EventTrigger(val eventType: String) : Trigger()
}

sealed class Action {
    data class ApiCallAction(val connector: String, val method: String, val params: Map<String, Any>) : Action()
    data class NotificationAction(val title: String, val message: String) : Action()
    data class DelayAction(val milliseconds: Long) : Action()
    data class ConditionalAction(val condition: Condition, val action: Action) : Action()
}
```

#### Caching Strategy

**Data to Cache:**
- API responses (with TTL)
- Media metadata and thumbnails
- Entity states (HomeAssistant)
- Container information (Portainer)
- System metrics (Netdata)
- Library data (Jellyfin)

**Cache Implementation:**
```kotlin
interface CacheManager {
    suspend fun <T> get(key: String, type: Class<T>): T?
    suspend fun <T> put(key: String, value: T, ttl: Duration)
    suspend fun invalidate(key: String)
    suspend fun clear()
    fun getCacheSize(): Long
    fun getCacheHitRate(): Float
}
```

**Cache Layers:**
1. **Memory Cache:** LruCache for frequently accessed data
2. **Disk Cache:** Room database for persistent storage
3. **Image Cache:** Coil library for media caching

**Offline Mode:**
- Detect network connectivity
- Serve cached data when offline
- Queue operations for later sync
- Sync when connectivity restored
- Show offline indicator in UI

### 3.7: Performance Optimization

**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Estimated Effort:** 2 weeks
**Complexity:** LOW-MEDIUM

#### Retry Logic

**Exponential Backoff:**
```kotlin
suspend fun <T> retryWithBackoff(
    maxRetries: Int = 3,
    initialDelay: Long = 1000,
    factor: Double = 2.0,
    maxDelay: Long = 10000,
    block: suspend () -> T
): Result<T> {
    var currentDelay = initialDelay
    repeat(maxRetries) { attempt ->
        try {
            return Result.success(block())
        } catch (e: Exception) {
            if (attempt == maxRetries - 1) {
                return Result.failure(e)
            }
            delay(currentDelay)
            currentDelay = (currentDelay * factor).toLong().coerceAtMost(maxDelay)
        }
    }
    error("Unreachable")
}
```

#### Rate Limiting

**Token Bucket Algorithm:**
```kotlin
class RateLimiter(
    private val capacity: Int,
    private val refillRate: Int, // tokens per second
) {
    suspend fun acquire(tokens: Int = 1): Boolean {
        // Implementation
    }
}
```

**Per-Connector Limits:**
- HomeAssistant: 60 requests/minute
- Jellyfin: 100 requests/minute
- Portainer: 120 requests/minute
- Netdata: Unlimited (local monitoring)

#### Request Deduplication

Prevent duplicate concurrent requests:
```kotlin
class RequestDeduplicator {
    private val pending = mutableMapOf<String, Deferred<*>>()

    suspend fun <T> deduplicate(key: String, block: suspend () -> T): T
}
```

#### Image Optimization
- WebP format for smaller sizes
- Lazy loading for lists
- Thumbnail generation
- Progressive loading

#### Test Coverage
