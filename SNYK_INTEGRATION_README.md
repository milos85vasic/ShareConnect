- **License Compliance**: Checks for license compatibility issues

### ü§ñ AI QA Integration
- **Automated Execution**: Snyk scans run as part of AI QA test suites
- **Integrated Reporting**: Combined reports showing both functional and security test results
- **Quality Gates**: Automated pass/fail decisions based on vulnerability severity

### üê≥ Docker Integration
- **Containerized Scanning**: Runs in isolated Docker containers
- **On-Demand Scanning**: Quick scans without full environment setup
- **CI/CD Ready**: Easy integration with build pipelines

## Setup Instructions

### Option 1: Full Snyk Experience (Recommended)

#### 1. Obtain Snyk API Token

1. Sign up for a Snyk account at [snyk.io](https://snyk.io)
2. Navigate to Account Settings ‚Üí API Token
3. Generate a new token with appropriate permissions
4. Set the environment variable:

```bash
export SNYK_TOKEN=your_snyk_token_here
```

**Benefits with token:**
- ‚úÖ Full dependency scanning
- ‚úÖ Container image scanning
- ‚úÖ Private repository support
- ‚úÖ Advanced reporting and analytics
- ‚úÖ Integration with Snyk dashboard
- ‚úÖ Unlimited scans

### Option 2: Freemium Mode (No Token Required)

ShareConnect supports running Snyk in freemium mode without an API token for basic security scanning.

**Freemium limitations:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited scan frequency
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Public repositories only
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Basic vulnerability detection
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No container scanning
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No advanced reporting
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No dashboard integration

**To use freemium mode:**
```bash
# Simply run without setting SNYK_TOKEN
./snyk_scan_on_demand.sh --severity medium
```

**Freemium mode is ideal for:**
- Getting started with security scanning
- Open source projects
- Basic vulnerability awareness
- Learning about security practices

### 2. Configure Organization (Optional)

If you have a Snyk organization, set the organization ID:

```bash
export SNYK_ORG_ID=your_org_id_here
```

### 3. Environment Setup

The integration automatically detects and uses:
- Local Snyk CLI (if installed)
- Docker-based scanning (fallback)
- Environment-specific configurations

## Usage

### Quick Security Scan

Run a fast security scan on-demand:

```bash
# With token (full functionality)
export SNYK_TOKEN=your_token_here
./snyk_scan_on_demand.sh --severity medium

# Without token (freemium mode)
./snyk_scan_on_demand.sh --severity medium
```

Options:
- `--severity high`: Only report high/critical vulnerabilities
- `--fail-on-issues`: Exit with error code if vulnerabilities found (token mode only)

### Comprehensive Security Scan

Run full security analysis with detailed reporting:

```bash
# With token (full functionality)
export SNYK_TOKEN=your_token_here
./run_snyk_scan.sh --scan

# Without token (freemium mode - limited)
./run_snyk_scan.sh --scan  # Will show freemium limitations
```

Options:
- `--deps-only`: Scan dependencies only
- `--container-only`: Scan containers only (token required)
- `--gradle-only`: Scan Gradle files only
- `--severity LEVEL`: Set severity threshold (low|medium|high|critical)

### Integrated AI QA + Security Testing

Run complete testing including security scans:

```bash
# With token (full functionality)
export SNYK_TOKEN=your_token_here
./run_ai_qa_with_snyk.sh

# Without token (freemium mode)
./run_ai_qa_with_snyk.sh  # Security scan will run in freemium mode
```

This combines:
- AI-powered functional testing
- Security vulnerability scanning (freemium or full mode)
- Integrated reporting and analysis

### Docker-Based Scanning

Start Snyk containers for persistent scanning:

```bash
./run_snyk_scan.sh --start
./run_snyk_scan.sh --scan
./run_snyk_scan.sh --stop
```

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    environment {
        SNYK_TOKEN = credentials('snyk-token')
    }
    stages {
        stage('Security Scan') {
            steps {
                sh './snyk_scan_on_demand.sh --fail-on-issues'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Vulnerability Management

### Automated Fixes
- Snyk suggests specific version upgrades
- Dependency updates with compatibility checking
- Automated PR creation for fixes

### Manual Review Process
1. **Triage**: Classify vulnerabilities by severity and impact
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate exploitability and business risk
3. **Remediation**: Apply fixes or implement mitigations
4. **Verification**: Re-scan to confirm resolution

### Risk Assessment Matrix

| Severity | Impact | Likelihood | Action |
|----------|--------|------------|--------|
| Critical | High   | High       | Fix immediately |
| High     | High   | Medium     | Fix in 24-48 hours |
| Medium   | Medium | Medium     | Fix in next sprint |
| Low      | Low    | Low        | Monitor and plan |

## Monitoring and Alerts

- Real-time vulnerability tracking
- Trend analysis over time
- Compliance reporting
- Risk scoring

### Notification Channels
- **Slack**: Real-time alerts for new vulnerabilities
- **Email**: Weekly security summaries
- **JIRA**: Automatic ticket creation for critical issues
- **Dashboard**: Web-based security status overview

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "SNYK_TOKEN not set"
```bash
export SNYK_TOKEN=your_token_here
```

#### "Docker not running"
```bash
# Start Docker service
sudo systemctl start docker
# Or use local Snyk CLI
npm install -g snyk
```

#### "Scan timeout"
- Increase timeout in configuration
- Run partial scans (`--deps-only`)
- Check network connectivity

#### "False positives"
- Use `.snyk` file to exclude known false positives
- Report issues to Snyk support
- Add custom ignore rules

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging:

```bash
export SNYK_DEBUG=true
./snyk_scan_on_demand.sh
```
