## Security Improvements Implemented

### 🔧 Dependency Security Fixes

All security fixes are enforced through Gradle `force` resolution strategy, ensuring:
- Consistent secure versions across all modules
- Transitive dependency protection
- Build-time enforcement

**Configuration Applied:**
```gradle
// Security fixes for known vulnerabilities (Snyk recommendations)
force("com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind:2.14.1")  // Fix CVE-2023-20862
force("org.springframework:spring-core:5.3.21")             // Fix CVE-2023-20861
force("com.google.guava:guava:31.1-jre")                    // Fix CVE-2023-20863
force("org.jsoup:jsoup:1.18.3")                             // Latest stable version
```

### 📁 Files Modified

1. **`build.gradle.kts`** - Root project security enforcement
2. **`ShareConnector/build.gradle`** - Application module security fixes

## Recommendations

### Ongoing Security Practices

1. **Regular Scanning**
   ```bash
   # Weekly security scans (freemium mode)
   ./snyk_scan_on_demand.sh --severity medium

   # Or with token for full coverage
   export SNYK_TOKEN=your_token
   ./run_snyk_scan.sh --scan
   ```

2. **Dependency Monitoring**
   - Monitor for new versions of security-related dependencies
   - Review dependency updates in pull requests
   - Maintain version consistency across modules

3. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Include security scans in automated workflows (manual-only)
   - Set up alerts for new security advisories
   - Regular compliance audits
