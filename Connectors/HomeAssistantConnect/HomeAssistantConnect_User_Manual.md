## Tips and Tricks

### Productivity Tips

1. **Create Morning Routine Scene**: Group all morning actions (open blinds, start coffee, set thermostat) into one scene for one-tap activation.

2. **Use Automation Geofencing**: Set up automations to trigger when your phone enters/exits home zone for hands-free control.

3. **Organize by Room**: Create separate dashboard tabs for each room for easier navigation.

4. **Quick Access Widget**: Place a 4x4 dashboard widget on your home screen for instant access without opening the app.

5. **Scene Shortcuts**: Create Android shortcuts for your most-used scenes:
   - Long-press app icon
   - Drag scene shortcut to home screen

### Energy Saving Tips

1. **Extend Update Interval**: Set to 1-5 minutes instead of 5-30 seconds.

2. **Disable WebSocket When Away**: Turn off real-time updates when you're not home.

3. **Limit Widgets**: Each widget consumes battery checking for updates.

4. **Use Dark Theme**: OLED screens use less power with dark pixels.

5. **Enable Battery Optimization**: Allow Android to manage app background activity.

### Customization Tips

1. **Custom Theme**: Create a theme matching your home decor colors.

2. **Entity Icons**: In Home Assistant, customize entity icons for better visual recognition.

3. **Entity Names**: Use clear, descriptive names ("Kitchen Ceiling Light" vs "Light 1").

4. **Dashboard Layouts**: Create multiple dashboards:
   - Main: Most used controls
   - Monitoring: All sensors
   - Media: All media players
   - Security: Cameras and locks

5. **Conditional Cards**: In Home Assistant, use conditional cards to show/hide based on state (e.g., show vacuum controls only when cleaning).

### Security Tips

1. **Use HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS for external connections.

2. **Strong Access Token**: Home Assistant access tokens should be kept secure like passwords.

3. **Enable Biometric Lock**: Prevent unauthorized access if phone is lost.

4. **Separate User**: Create a dedicated Home Assistant user for the app with limited permissions if sharing device.

5. **Regular Token Rotation**: Periodically generate new access tokens and update app.

### Advanced Tips

1. **Template Sensors**: Create template sensors in Home Assistant for complex calculations and display in app.

2. **Lovelace Raw Config**: For ultimate dashboard control, edit Lovelace YAML in Home Assistant then sync to app.

3. **Input Helpers**: Use input_boolean, input_number, and input_select for custom controls.

4. **RESTful Commands**: Create custom services in Home Assistant for advanced control.

5. **Markdown Cards**: Add rich formatted information to dashboard with markdown cards.
