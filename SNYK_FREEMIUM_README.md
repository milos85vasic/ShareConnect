# ShareConnect Snyk Freemium Mode

## Overview

ShareConnect now supports **Snyk Freemium Mode** - allowing you to run basic security scanning **without any API token or account setup**. This makes security scanning accessible to everyone while providing a clear upgrade path to full Snyk capabilities.

## What is Freemium Mode?

Freemium mode provides basic vulnerability detection capabilities using Snyk's free tier, with some limitations compared to the full token-based experience.

## Getting Started (No Setup Required!)

### Quick Start

```bash
# Just run - no token needed!
./snyk_scan_on_demand.sh --severity medium
```

That's it! The script will automatically detect freemium mode and provide appropriate scanning capabilities.

## Freemium Mode Features

### ‚úÖ What's Included

- **Basic Dependency Scanning**: Scan Gradle dependencies for known vulnerabilities
- **Vulnerability Detection**: Identify security issues in your dependencies
- **Severity Filtering**: Filter results by vulnerability severity
- **Basic Reporting**: Text-based reports with vulnerability summaries
- **Integration Ready**: Works with AI QA testing framework
- **No Cost**: Completely free to use
- **No Account Required**: Start scanning immediately

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Limitations

- **Private Repositories**: Limited support for private repositories
- **Scan Frequency**: Rate limiting may apply
- **Container Scanning**: Not available without token
- **Advanced Reporting**: Limited to basic text reports
- **Dashboard Integration**: No web dashboard access
- **License Scanning**: Limited license compliance checking
- **API Access**: No programmatic API access

## Usage Examples

### Basic Security Check

```bash
./snyk_scan_on_demand.sh --severity medium
```

Output:
```

üîß Testing configuration... ‚úÖ
üì¶ Scanning dependencies... ‚ö†Ô∏è (Freemium limitations)
üìä Generating reports... ‚úÖ

‚ö†Ô∏è Freemium mode detected - limited scanning results

FREEMIUM LIMITATIONS:
- Limited scan frequency
- No private repository support
- Basic vulnerability detection only
- No advanced reporting features

Status: Freemium mode - upgrade to token for full functionality
```

### Integrated QA Testing

```bash
./run_ai_qa_with_snyk.sh
```

The integrated testing will automatically use freemium mode for security scanning when no token is provided.

## Best Practices for Freemium Mode

### When to Use Freemium

- **Getting Started**: Learn about security scanning
- **Open Source Projects**: Perfect for public repositories
- **Development Teams**: Quick security checks during development
- **CI/CD Evaluation**: Test security integration before committing to token
- **Educational Use**: Learn security practices

### Optimizing Freemium Usage

1. **Focus on Public Repos**: Freemium works best with public repositories
2. **Use Appropriate Severity**: Start with `medium` severity threshold
3. **Regular Scanning**: Scan regularly but respect rate limits
4. **Combine with AI QA**: Use integrated testing for comprehensive results

### Rate Limiting Awareness

- Freemium mode has scan frequency limits
- Space out scans appropriately
- Consider upgrading for unlimited scanning

## Troubleshooting Freemium Mode

### Common Issues

**"Freemium scan failed - this is expected for private repos"**
- This is normal for private repositories
- Try with a public repository or upgrade to token

**"Container scanning not available in freemium mode"**
- Container scanning requires a Snyk token
- This is expected behavior

**Rate Limiting**
- If you hit scan limits, wait before trying again
- Consider upgrading to token for unlimited scans
