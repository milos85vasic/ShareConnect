# Sharrow Branding Guide

## Logo Design

The Sharrow logo combines the concepts of "share" and "arrow" into a single, memorable icon. The design represents the core function of the application - sharing content through a directional arrow metaphor.

### Color Palette

- **Warm Orange (#FF9800)**: Represents energy, enthusiasm, and the act of sharing
- **Carmine Red (#C62828)**: Symbolizes action, urgency, and importance
- **Blue (#2196F3)**: Represents technology, trust, and connectivity
- **White (#FFFFFF)**: Provides contrast and clarity

### Logo Variations

1. **Full Logo**: Contains the arrow icon with abstract share elements
2. **Icon Only**: Simplified arrow icon for app icons and small spaces
3. **Monochrome**: Single-color version for use on different backgrounds

## Design Principles

- **Simplicity**: Clean, recognizable shapes that work at any size
- **Scalability**: Maintains clarity from app icons to large displays
- **Versatility**: Works on both light and dark backgrounds
- **Meaningful**: Clearly represents the sharing functionality

## Usage Guidelines

- Always maintain adequate clear space around the logo
- Do not distort or alter the logo proportions
- Use the monochrome version when the full color logo is not suitable
- Ensure proper contrast when placing on different backgrounds

## File Formats

- SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) - Primary format
